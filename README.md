# IoT-Project
This project allow us to parking cars without human interference.

  In this project we use Firebase to store and retrieve data in cloud service. And to read RFID unique id with RFID reader we write a code
in Arduino IDE.

  Nevertheless to see a car driver's parking fee we write a android code. Thus we can retrieve data from Firebase database 
due to NFC reader of smart phones.
